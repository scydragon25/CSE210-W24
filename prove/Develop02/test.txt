What was the best part of my day?
As hard as the drive to and fro was, I would definitely have to say that the best part of my day was picking up my In-laws in SLC. I got to spend plenty of time listening to ReDawn and Evershore. Plus I also to spend alone time, just chatting, with my In-laws. Beside that I did enjoy working on homework with my classmates.
