Budgeting App
by Joseph Wisden

As the name might imply, this program functions primarily as a budgeting tool, where you can plan ahead for differing sources of income and expenses. The app will then in turn allow the user to cleanly display the entire budgeting, supply the overall totals and net balance. 

Additionally the user can edit or even remove transactions. The user can even mark if a transaction has occured, and the budget will display these line items in a different color for easy recognition. 

Behind all of this, the user can also include overarching goals, and get back from the app whether the goal(s) have been planned for, or actually happened.

The app will also save/load the budget/goal(s).

Areas I would have wanted to improve upon:
# Allow the user to search and display only certain catelogs of transactions.
# Goals that can be more specific (such as spend only $100 in a particular category).
# Accept many date formats from the user, but then display them all the same.
# A Function for printing the budget to a file for physically printing.
